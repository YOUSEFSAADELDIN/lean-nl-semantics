# Noun encodings compared: does nouns-as-types buy anything?

The end-to-end pipeline states every claim with nouns as predicates over
one domain, under opaque fused names (`competentLegalAuthority`). This
directory asks whether stating the *same* parsed sentences with nouns as
types (MTT) changes what follows. Everything before the semantic target is
held fixed: the parser, the ranker, discourse resolution, the readings,
the lexical classes, and the prover.

## The encodings

Each is produced from the pipeline's resolved trees by its own renderer:

| | nouns | adjectives | prior work |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F** fused (the pipeline today) | opaque predicate per noun phrase (`competentLegalAuthority : A → Prop`) | part of the name; `background.py` adds the entailments | this repo |
| **P** extensional Montague | `N : E → Prop` | intersective `E → Prop`; others predicate modifiers `(E → Prop) → E → Prop` | Montague; linglib |
| **W** intensional Montague | `N : W → E → Prop`, premises at `w₀` | intersective `W → E → Prop`; others `(W → E → Prop) → W → E → Prop` | Montague (PTQ) |
| **M** MTT | codes `N : CN` with carriers `El N` and `emb N : El N → E` | intersective `E → Prop`; others indexed by the noun, `(n : CN) → El n → Prop` | Luo; Chatzikyriakidis & Luo |

All four use the same lexical classes (`background.py`'s `INTERSECTIVE`,
`EXTENSIONAL_SUBSECTIVE`, `PRIVATIVE`; every other adjective subsective),
and each states the facts its encoding does not supply as explicit,
counted postulates:

- **subsectivity** ("a competent N is an N"): a postulate in P and W, one
  per adjective; *built in* in M (an element of `El N` is an N).
- **privativity** ("a former N is not an N"): a postulate in all four.
- **extensional subsectivity** ("fat" depends only on the noun's members,
  FraCoq's `ExtensionalSubsectiveA`): free in P (and so, wrongly, for
  every adjective); a postulate in W and M.
- the **degree lexicon** (contraries, comparatives): the same postulates
  in all four.

## What is measured

1. Matched and wrong answers per section, with one generic prover for all
   encodings (the pipeline's specialised tactics are built for F's shape;
   F is also reported with them, separately).
2. **Commitments**: whether an encoding makes a wrong answer *valid*, not
   just whether the prover finds it. `MTT/Intensionality.lean` proves P
   forces FraCaS 215 to "yes" (`extensional_forces_215`); the comparison
   checks that against the generated claims.
3. **Postulates**: how many stipulated facts each encoding needs for the
   answers it gets.
4. **What each can state at all** (Phase 1b): dependent anaphora as
   Σ-types (`MTT/DependentAnaphora.lean`) against F's stipulated
   functions.

## Predictions, stated before the results

- Section 5: P answers 215 wrongly (it is valid in P); F, W and M get
  214 and 215 right. M needs no subsectivity postulates; W and P need one
  per subsective adjective. Otherwise the four agree.
- Section 3: F, P and W need a stipulated function per possessive or
  dependency ("her workstation"); M states the same problems with Σ-types
  and no stipulation. Classically the claims are equivalent, so accuracy
  should not differ; what differs is what is assumed. M misses 133
  (maximality), which F gets through its E-type description.
- Overall: no accuracy edge for M over W, a validity edge over P, and
  fewer postulates than either.

## Phases

- **1a**: Section 5 (adjectives), all four encodings.
- **1b**: Section 3 (anaphora): F against M.
- **2**: the remaining sections, where a tie is expected.

These are development-set problems, as everywhere in this project.
